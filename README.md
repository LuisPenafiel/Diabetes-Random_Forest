# Predicting diabetes
## Instructions

We should load the processed dataset from the previous project (split into training and test samples and analyzed with EDA).
One way to optimize and improve the results when using decision trees is to generate a random forest with enough trees so that there is the necessary variety to enrich the prediction. Train it and analyze its results. Try modifying the two hyperparameters that define the tree with different values and analyze their impact on the final accuracy and plot the conclusions.

#### Step 0: PIP & All Import
Import what it is needed.

#### Step 1: Data Import
Load Datase

#### Step 2: Exploration and Data Cleaning
Explore the data by following the common steps in the process.

#### Step 3: Visualization
We visualize different attributes of the data to gain insights on how to proceed. For example, analyzing the correlation between diabetes and the different variables will be fundamental in identifying irrelevant data.

#### Step 4 : Feature selection
Feature Selection: Identifying and choosing the most relevant features to improve model performance, reduce dimensionality, and enhance computational efficiency.

#### Step 5 Decision Tree model

we apply the Random Forest to the clean Data

#### Step 6: Model optimization

The Model is imporved using Gridsearch letting the algorith to choose the better hyperparameters to Boost the model accuraccy.

#### Step 7: Save Model

Using Pickle we save the Model
